# Order book

There's an OrderBook class which implements a simplified [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) (an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a security or other instrument organized by price level).

It has the following functionality (and tests to all of them):
- placing new orders
- cancelling orders by id
- getting order info by id
- getting aggregated and sorted market data
